Before a bill becomes a law, it will have\r\n  undergone a usually lengthy and complicated process of negotiation that frequently results\r\n  in a significant divergence between the initial and final versions of bills. Currently,\r\n  keeping track of the significant changes to a particular bill requires an excellent\r\n  eye for detail and a lot of patient reading.  Legislative stakeholders and the public\r\n  deserve a simpler way to follow changes to congressional legislation during a bill's \r\n  lifecycle. LawTracker is an open source software tool that allows regular citizens to \r\n  collaborate in the legislative process by suggesting changes to congressional legislation \r\n  and transparently tracking changes made to bills during the legislative lifecycle.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nNavigate to the law tracker website, and log in or sign up. Click new bill to create a new bill, and you should see your new bill in the dashboard view\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n- Express 3.x\r\n- jQuery\r\n- angular 1.2.20\r\n- bootstrap 3.2\r\n\r\n## Development\r\n\r\n### Installing Dependencies\r\n\r\nFrom within the root directory:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nsudo npm install -g bower\r\nnpm install\r\nbower install\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Tasks\r\n\r\nSee the projects backlog in asana [here](https://app.asana.com/0/14524854723420/14616907024583)\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for contribution guidelines.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
